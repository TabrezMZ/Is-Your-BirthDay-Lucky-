# Is-Your-BirthDay-Lucky ?

An app written in Javascript where a user can input his/her Birthdate and lucky number and the app will run a basic calculation of division to show whether the Birthdate is lucky or not.

This app's logic is probably called "dumb logic" in coding dictionary. I coded this app just to get better at Javascript in general and Modulus calculations to be specific. UI of the app is also very simple looking as this is kind of personal project rather than something which will users actually use.
